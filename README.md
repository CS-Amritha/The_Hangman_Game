This repository hosts the code for a classic Hangman game implemented in both C and Python languages. The game is designed to be played in the terminal, providing a fun and interactive experience for users. The repository aims to provide an open-source resource for Hangman enthusiasts to explore, contribute to, and improve upon.

C Version:

The C version of the Hangman game is implemented using standard C libraries and features terminal-based gameplay. Users are presented with a word to guess along with a corresponding hint. They make guesses by inputting letters, with incorrect guesses resulting in the display of a Hangman figure as they accumulate wrong moves. The game continues until the user either guesses the word correctly or exhausts their allowed wrong moves. Additionally, the C version includes functionality to record and display player scores in a text file.

Python Version:

The Python version of the Hangman game also operates in the terminal environment and provides similar gameplay mechanics. It allows players to select a difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard) and provides a corresponding word to guess along with a hint. Users input guesses, and the game responds by updating the Hangman illustration for incorrect guesses and displaying the progress of correctly guessed letters. The game concludes when the player either correctly guesses the word or exhausts their allotted wrong moves. Similar to the C version, the Python implementation includes functionality to record and display player scores, encouraging competitive play.

Future Development:

In future iterations, we envision expanding the Hangman game beyond the terminal environment to include a web-based interface. This will involve developing a front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the user experience with interactive elements and visual enhancements. Additionally, we plan to integrate a database backend, such as SQLite or MySQL, to store game data, including player scores, game history, and word repositories. This expansion will enable features such as user account management, leaderboard tracking, and the ability to add custom word lists, further enhancing the game's replayability and community engagement.

Conclusion:

The Hangman Game Repository on GitHub provides a platform for both novice and experienced developers to contribute to the development and improvement of Hangman games. With its open-source nature and planned expansions into web-based gameplay and database integration, the repository aims to foster collaboration and innovation within the Hangman gaming community. Whether you're a developer looking to sharpen your skills, a Hangman enthusiast eager to play and share custom word lists, or a contributor interested in expanding the game's features, we welcome you to join us on this exciting journey.
